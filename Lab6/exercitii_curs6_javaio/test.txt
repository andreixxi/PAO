The second hand on my watch stops
All my focus is just on you
I don’t want anything else
As long as you come to me

I promise no danger, forget your fear
Trust me, I won’t make you regret it
A drop of curiosity spreads through your heart and attacks you

Follow me cuz I’m so desperate, you pretend not to know
Come into this desperate time
You’ve shaken me up completely
Stay for a lot longer, desperate
desperate

I asked you
What fairy tale you dreamt of
There’s nothing I can’t do
So I’ll put you in your own paradise

I’ll throw my body into it harder and make a path first
Because for you, it’s possible
A missed step changes your fate, overwhelms you

Follow me cuz I’m so desperate, you pretend not to know
Come into this desperate time
You’ve shook up my everything
Stay for a lot longer, desperate
desperate

HA I thirst for you
I deny everything that isn’t you
And kick out in rebellion
Yeah, even if you’re an oasis without a drop of water
I gotta crush on you
I’m never done paying my dues
In my dreams I stop at nothing ho
I’m struggling
Even if everything is pandemonium, I’m desperate again

All that I need is your name
Engraved deeply in my mind

Tell me If you’re so desperate, I pretend not to know
I’ll turn away in the frozen time
The only thing I know for sure is you can’t forget me

Come back and find me, desperate
desperate

I can’t let go of you, you can’t let go of me
Completely desirously desperate
Oh desperate
